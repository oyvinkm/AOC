Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

The equation will therefore be: 
dist/ms = x
time_left = (t - x)
distance = (t-x) * x = tx - x^2
